                    <h4>Safety Tips</h4>
                </div>
                <p>1. Never provide your personal or banking information.<br />
                Do not give out personal, credit card or online account details (e.g. social insurance number, bank account number) over the Internet/email. We advise only buying and selling with people you can meet. Fraudsters don't meet people, that's how they get caught!</p>
                
                <p>2. Never send or wire money to sellers or buyers.<br />
                his includes never mailing a cheque or using payment services like Western Union or Money Gram to pay for items found on No Flies.</p>
                
                <p>3. Beware of the Overpayment Scams and bounced cheques.<br />
                Be suspicious if you are overpaid for products and a number of credit card numbers are used. The scammer is expecting you to/will transfer the refund; either paying for the freight before then discovering the cheque they sent out to you has bounced or before realising the money order/credit cards details they produced were phoney.
                </p>
				<p>4. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
                Especially when deal seems too good to be true, price is too low, rent is below market, etc. Be careful when buying expensive items like mobile phones, laptops, plasma tvs, airline tickets and even tickets for shows/gigs.
                </p>
                <p>5. NoFlies does not offer any sort of buyer protection or payment programs.<br />
                NoFlies does not act as an intermediary and does not make arrangements for any payments or transactions. If you are contacted by someone who claims to be from NoFlies and you are asked to transfer money for an item for sale, this will be an illegitimate request and any emails you receive of this type will also be fraudulent. DO NOT follow any of the instructions contained within the email or given over the phone. If you receive any emails promoting these services, please immediately report it to us.
                </p>
